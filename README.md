# UNSPLASH
I chose Unsplash among the two platforms. (Unsplah or Pexels)

I created a class called UnsplashClass under App\Services. 
> The command that needs to be typed from terminal to get photographers from API:

``` php artisan get:photographers ```

> The command that needs to be typed from terminal to get photos and photo links from API:

``` php artisan get:photos ```

> Tables were created for photographers, photos and photo links.

## ROUTES
/photographers - You can access the table listing all photographers informations.

/photos - You can access the table listing all photos.
